<h2>What is HTTP?</h2>

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server.

Example: A client (browser) submits an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.

Two commonly used methods for a request-response between a client and server are: GET and POST.

    <h3>GET</h3> - Requests data from a specified resource
    <h3>POST</h3> - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource
  <h2>The GET Method</h2>
  <h4>ex :</h4> /test/demo_form.asp?name1=value1&name2=value2
  <br>
  <h2>The POST Method</h2>
POST /test/demo_form.asp 
Host: example.com
name1=value1&name2=value2
