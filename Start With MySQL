To work with this code; hope you have some DBMS Knowledge. and im not goigng to discuss that matters here.
To work with PHP+MySQL first we have to use following methods.
    1. mysql_connect()
    2. mysql_select_db()
    3. mysql_close()
    
those methods are use for following purposes respectfully..
    1. Open a connection to MySQL itself
    2. Specify the database we want to open
    3. Close the connection

01. Open Connection
    <?PHP
    
    $user_name = "root";
    $password = "";
    $database = "MyDB";
    $server = "127.0.0.1";
    
    mysql_connect($server, $user_name, $password);
    
    print "Connection to the Server opened";
    
    ?>

02. Specify the database you want to open
    $database = "MyDB";
    
      $db_work = mysql_connect($server, $user_name, $password);
      
      $db_found = mysql_select_db($database, $db_work);
      
      if ($db_found) {
      
      print "Database Found " . $db_work;
      
      }
      else {
      
      print "Database NOT Found " . $db_work;
      
      }
    
03. Close the connection
    mysql_close( $db_work );
    
Final full Code
    <?PHP
    
    $user_name = "root";
    $password = "";
    $database = "MyDB";
    $server = "127.0.0.1";
    
    $db_work = mysql_connect($server, $user_name, $password);
    
    $db_found = mysql_select_db($database, $db_work);
    
    if ($db_found) {
    
    print "Database Found ";
    mysql_close($db_work);
    
    }
    else {
    
    print "Database NOT Found ";
    
    }
    
    ?>
    
    Now that we've got a connection to the database, it's time to look at how you can access the data in the database
